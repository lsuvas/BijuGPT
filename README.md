Note:-

The MySQL installation document might be a little dated. In the latest installation options there is a checkbox
that needs to be checked to include the path of the installation which adds MySQL to the PATH environment variable
so that you can access mysql from the command line without providing the full path. Also during installation remember
the root password you provide.You will need it later to connect to MySQL.
